# Agent Sandbox Workflow

Use a detached agent sandbox when an AI agent needs to explore risky or creative changes without mutating the main checkout.

## Default Rule

Normal work still happens on `main`. This repo remains main-only: do not create side branches, push sandbox commits, or open PRs unless Patrick explicitly asks for that workflow.

For risky experiments, create a detached worktree:

```powershell
.\tools\New-AgentSandbox.ps1 -Name surface-sync
```

Review the sandbox diff, then integrate only selected changes back into the main checkout:

```powershell
git -C C:\Dev\Sprout-agent-sandboxes\surface-sync diff
```

Remove the sandbox when finished:

```powershell
.\tools\Remove-AgentSandbox.ps1 -NameOrPath surface-sync
```

## Use A Sandbox For

- Budget math, month rollover, persistence, backup, or quick-entry experiments.
- Comparing `Sprout-html/` behavior against `Sprout-iOS/`.
- Multiple UI or product-flow variants.
- Broad audits where agents inspect independent risk areas.

## Skip A Sandbox For

- Tiny copy changes.
- Narrow bug fixes with an obvious file owner.
- Documentation-only edits that do not change operating rules.

The sandbox is for isolation, not final delivery. Final validation, commit, and push happen from `C:\Dev\Sprout` on `main`.
